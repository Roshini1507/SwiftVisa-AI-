# SwiftVisa: AI-Based Visa Eligibility Screening Chatbot
SwiftVisa AI is an intelligent visa eligibility assistant that analyzes immigration policies and evaluates visa eligibility using RAG and LLM reasoning  based on official immigration policy documents and real-time web information. The system uses a conversational chatbot interface to collect user information and determine visa eligibility using grounded policy reasoning.
## Project Overview
SwiftVisa is a Streamlit-based chatbot that helps users understand whether they may qualify for a specific visa category.
### Core Technologies:
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Vector Embeddings
FAISS Vector Database
Live Web Search (Fallback mechanism)
LLM (Google Gemini)
[!IMPORTANT]Instead of hallucinating answers, the chatbot retrieves official immigration policies and uses them to generate grounded responses.
## Features
1. Conversational Chatbot Interface: The assistant collects user information through a chat conversation instead of static forms.
```
Assistant: What is your age?
User: 25
Assistant: What is your nationality?
User: India
Assistant: What is your education level?
User: Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
```
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The chatbot retrieves relevant immigration policies from a vector database built from visa policy documents.
### The Pipeline:
```
User -> QueryVector -> Search(FAISS) -> Relevant Policy Chunks -> LLM Reasoning -> Eligibility Decision
```
3. Metadata-Based Document Filtering: Documents are filtered using metadata (e.g., Country, Visa type) to improve retrieval accuracy.
Example: USA + H1B $\rightarrow$ retrieves only H1B policies.
4. Live Web Search Integration: If the knowledge base lacks sufficient information, the system performs a real-time web search to retrieve the latest immigration updates, ensuring responses remain current.
5. Concise vs. Detailed Response Modes
### Components
Concise : Status, Short Explanation, Confidence Score
Detailed: Status, Explanation, Policy References, Missing Info, Confidence Score
6. Policy Source Transparency:
Users can view the specific policy documents used to generate the answer, ensuring transparency and explainability.
